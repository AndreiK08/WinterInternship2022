WinterInternship2022

I have tried my best to replicate the received design :) 
I don't have experience with NodeJs, the solution that I chose for implementing the web application was to build a page that has invisible pages, made available on buton click.  
I chose to implement the form validation in JS and to send the data from the form in a new html page.
